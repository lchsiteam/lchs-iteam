# LCHS iTeam Website

This is the repository for the LCHS iTeam Website (static version). It's been rewritten and redesigned for others without a lot of programming experience to easily jump in and code (as opposed to the Vue website).

This is still a very new project and a very new proposal. Please take the time to explore the website locally and dive into the code, then make suggestions.

## How To Run

First, clone this repository in an ideal location.

```
git clone https://github.com/lchsiteam/website
```

Then, with Python 3 already installed on your machine, change directories into the website files, then run the web server command. These two steps can be shown below:

```
cd website
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Use your browser to navigate to `localhost:8000`.

## List of Things To Be Done

- Home page + other pages aren't mobile friendly
- Home page design is lacking -- someone should give it some more color and spruce it up
- Filling in pages for subdomain, members, projects, etc.
- Giving project elements a proper styling
- Color....
- maybe a logo would be nice?
